FAIL
1. Missing requirement: The SRS does not specify functional requirements for system administrators or a back-office administrative interface. There is no mention of how user accounts (both customers and restaurant staff) are created, approved, or deactivated by an administrative role, nor how system-wide issues, disputes, or promotions are managed.
2. Missing requirement: There is no explicit requirement for handling order modifications or cancellations by the customer after placement, nor for the restaurant's ability to reject or modify an order due to unavailability. FR3 and FR5 imply a linear flow but lack specifications for these critical exception paths.
3. Ambiguity: Requirement NFR4.1 states "The system SHALL have an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80 or higher." This is ambiguous as the SUS is a post-deployment measurement tool, not a design requirement. It does not specify *how* this score will be achieved or validated during development, making it non-verifiable as a requirement.
4. Inconsistency: Constraint #3 states "The system must support multiple languages (English, Spanish, French) in phase 2." However, there are no corresponding functional or non-functional requirements (e.g., under Usability or a separate Internationalization section) that define what "support" entails (e.g., UI translation, content localization, currency/date formats). This creates a gap between the constraint and the specified requirements.
5. Missing requirement: The SRS lacks explicit requirements for the delivery personnel/driver interface and workflow. While FR5.4 mentions contacting delivery personnel and Assumption #5 mentions drivers using their own apps, there are no functional requirements for assigning orders to drivers, providing them with order details, or allowing them to update their status (e.g., "Picked Up"). This is a core component of a food ordering system.
