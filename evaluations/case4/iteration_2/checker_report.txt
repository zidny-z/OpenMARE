FAIL
1. Missing requirement: The SRS does not specify how the system handles payment for guest checkout orders. FR-PP1 lists accepted payment methods, but it is unclear if guest users can save payment methods or if they must enter details each time. This creates a gap in the payment workflow for a defined user path.
2. Ambiguity: In FR-OM3.2, the requirement states customers can request modifications "by contacting customer support through the system interface." This is ambiguous. It does not specify if this is an automated self-service feature (e.g., a button) or a manual process (e.g., a chat/phone call), leading to potential misinterpretation of the system's functionality.
3. Inconsistency: There is a conflict between FR-OM3.1 and FR-RM1.3. FR-OM3.1 states a customer can cancel an order within 5 minutes, provided the restaurant has not begun preparation. However, FR-RM1.3 states a restaurant has 3 minutes to accept or reject an order. This creates a race condition and logical conflict: Can a customer cancel during the restaurant's 3-minute decision window? What is the definitive state if a customer cancels at the 4-minute mark but the restaurant hasn't yet accepted? The requirements do not define the interaction between these two timers and states.
