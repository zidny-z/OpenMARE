FAIL
1. Missing requirement: The SRS does not specify how the system handles the creation of a user's first goal (FR1.3) if the user skips or exits the guided process. There is no requirement for a default state or alternative path to create a goal later.
2. Ambiguity: In FR3.1, the term "summing relevant logs" is ambiguous. It does not specify how the system determines which logs are "relevant" to a goal, particularly for goals with a "Weekly" recurrence period. The logic for grouping logs by week (e.g., calendar week vs. rolling 7-day window) is undefined.
3. Inconsistency: FR3.5.2 states offline data "SHALL be synchronized to the cloud backend automatically when a network connection is re-established." However, NFR2.3 states synchronization occurs "in the background without blocking the user interface." These are not contradictory, but the combination lacks a requirement for handling synchronization conflicts (e.g., if the same log is edited on two devices while offline). A conflict resolution strategy is missing.
