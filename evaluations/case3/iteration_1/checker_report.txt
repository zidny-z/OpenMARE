1. **Missing Requirement: Data Validation and Error Handling** - The SRS lacks requirements for validating user inputs (e.g., ensuring target values are positive numbers, handling invalid dates/times) and for system error handling (e.g., what the user sees if the app fails to save a logged activity or sync data). This is a critical omission for functional completeness and reliability.

2. **Ambiguity in Functional Requirements** - FR2.2 states the system shall display "different input interfaces based on activity type" and lists examples, but the defined list of activity types is not explicitly tied to these interfaces. The assumption (4.2) mentions four example types, but the requirement is ambiguous about whether these are the only types or if the system must handle an extensible set. The phrase "Step counter integration toggle" is also ambiguous—it's unclear if this enables automatic tracking or is just a manual input aid.

3. **Inconsistency Between Scope and Requirements** - The Scope (1.2) states that integration with external health data sources is to be determined during MVP scoping, yet a Functional Requirement (FR2.2) explicitly includes "Step counter integration toggle for walking activities." This creates a direct contradiction. Furthermore, NFR5.2 requires offline functionality, but no functional requirements specify how logging or progress calculation behaves when offline, or how data syncing is initiated/managed upon reconnection.
