Based on the provided stakeholder input, here are the clarified requirements, separated into functional and non-functional categories, using the prescribed wording and stating explicit assumptions.

**Assumptions:**
1.  The term "authorized staff" refers to individuals with verified credentials and role-based permissions within the hospital.
2.  "Existing hospital systems" refers to at least one other software system (e.g., lab information system, billing system) with which data exchange is necessary.
3.  "Healthcare regulations" primarily refer to data privacy and security standards such as HIPAA or regional equivalents.

### **Functional Requirements**

**FR-1: Patient Information Management**
*   The system SHALL provide a centralized, organized repository for patient medical histories, treatments, prescribed medications, and test results.
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to create, view, update, and deactivate patient records.
*   The system SHALL maintain a complete audit trail of all changes made to any patient record.

**FR-2: Appointment Scheduling**
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to book, reschedule, and cancel patient appointments.
*   The system SHALL prevent the double-booking of a patient, a staff member, or a room for the same date and time.
*   The system SHALL provide a view of scheduled appointments for patients, staff, and resources (e.g., rooms, equipment).

**FR-3: Inventory Management**
*   The system SHALL maintain a record of medical supplies, medications, and equipment, including quantities and locations.
*   The system SHALL update inventory quantities in real-time upon the recording of a disbursement or a new shipment receipt.
*   The system SHALL generate an alert when the quantity of a specific inventory item falls below a pre-defined threshold.

**FR-4: Staff Coordination & Communication**
*   The system SHALL provide a mechanism for authorized staff to send and receive internal messages or alerts.
*   The system SHALL allow the assignment of tasks or patients to specific staff members or roles.

**FR-5: System Integration**
*   The system SHALL be capable of exchanging data with existing, specified hospital systems.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

**NFR-1: Security & Compliance**
*   The system SHALL enforce access controls so that users can only view and modify data and functions explicitly permitted for their role.
*   The system SHALL encrypt all patient health information (PHI) both at rest and in transit.
*   The system SHALL generate logs of all user authentication attempts and data access events for audit purposes.
*   The system SHALL be designed to comply with relevant healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA).

**NFR-2: Reliability & Performance**
*   The system SHALL be available for use 99.5% of the time during core hospital operating hours.
*   The system SHALL support the concurrent use of the number of users equivalent to the hospital's staff count without significant performance degradation.
*   The system's response time for common transactions (e.g., retrieving a patient record, booking an appointment) SHALL be less than 3 seconds.

**NFR-3: Usability**
*   The system SHALL provide a user interface that enables a staff member with standard hospital IT training to complete core tasks (e.g., schedule an appointment, update a record) without external assistance.
*   The system SHALL provide context-sensitive help or guidance for critical functions.

**NFR-4: Scalability & Integration**
*   The system's architecture SHALL support an increase in patient record volume by 20% per year without requiring a major redesign.
*   The system SHALL use standardized protocols (e.g., HL7, FHIR, REST APIs) for integration with other systems.
