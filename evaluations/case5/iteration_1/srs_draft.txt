# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Hospital Management System

### 1. Introduction
This document specifies the requirements for a Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to streamline hospital operations, improve patient care coordination, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations. The system will serve as a centralized platform for managing patient information, appointments, inventory, and staff communication while integrating with existing hospital systems.

**Purpose:** To define the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive hospital management solution that addresses current operational inefficiencies and supports future growth.

**Scope:** The HMS will encompass patient information management, appointment scheduling, inventory tracking, staff coordination, and system integration capabilities. The system will be deployed within the hospital's secure network environment and will interface with existing laboratory, billing, and other clinical systems.

### 2. Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Patient Information Management**
*   The system SHALL provide a centralized, organized repository for patient medical histories, treatments, prescribed medications, and test results.
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to create, view, update, and deactivate patient records.
*   The system SHALL maintain a complete audit trail of all changes made to any patient record, including timestamp, user identification, and nature of change.

**FR-2: Appointment Scheduling**
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to book, reschedule, and cancel patient appointments.
*   The system SHALL prevent the double-booking of a patient, a staff member, or a room for the same date and time.
*   The system SHALL provide a view of scheduled appointments for patients, staff, and resources (e.g., rooms, equipment) through daily, weekly, and monthly calendar interfaces.

**FR-3: Inventory Management**
*   The system SHALL maintain a record of medical supplies, medications, and equipment, including quantities, locations, lot numbers, and expiration dates.
*   The system SHALL update inventory quantities in real-time upon the recording of a disbursement or a new shipment receipt.
*   The system SHALL generate an alert when the quantity of a specific inventory item falls below a pre-defined threshold, with alerts visible to designated staff roles.

**FR-4: Staff Coordination & Communication**
*   The system SHALL provide a mechanism for authorized staff to send and receive internal messages or alerts.
*   The system SHALL allow the assignment of tasks or patients to specific staff members or roles, with tracking of assignment status and completion.

**FR-5: System Integration**
*   The system SHALL be capable of exchanging data with existing, specified hospital systems, including patient demographic data, laboratory results, and billing information.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Security & Compliance**
*   The system SHALL enforce role-based access controls (RBAC) so that users can only view and modify data and functions explicitly permitted for their assigned role.
*   The system SHALL encrypt all patient health information (PHI) both at rest (using AES-256 encryption) and in transit (using TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   The system SHALL generate and retain immutable logs of all user authentication attempts and data access events for audit purposes for a minimum of six years.
*   The system SHALL be designed to comply with relevant healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA) in all data handling, storage, and transmission processes.

**NFR-2: Reliability & Performance**
*   The system SHALL maintain 99.5% availability during core hospital operating hours (06:00 to 22:00 local time, 365 days per year), excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
*   The system SHALL support concurrent use by the hospital's full staff count (estimated at 250 users) without significant performance degradation, maintaining functionality under peak load.
*   The system's response time for 95% of common transactions (e.g., retrieving a patient record, booking an appointment) SHALL be less than 3 seconds under normal operating conditions.

**NFR-3: Usability**
*   The system SHALL provide a user interface that enables a staff member with standard hospital IT training (8 hours or less) to complete core tasks (e.g., schedule an appointment, update a record) without external assistance on the first attempt.
*   The system SHALL provide context-sensitive help or guidance for critical functions accessible with one click or tap from the relevant interface.

**NFR-4: Scalability & Integration**
*   The system's architecture SHALL support an increase in patient record volume by 20% per year for five years without requiring a major redesign of the database or core application logic.
*   The system SHALL use standardized protocols (e.g., HL7, FHIR, REST APIs) for integration with other systems, with API documentation provided for all integration endpoints.

### 4. Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**
1.  The system must operate within the hospital's existing network infrastructure and security perimeter.
2.  Development must use technologies compatible with the hospital's current IT standards and supported platforms.
3.  Data migration from legacy systems must be completed with zero data loss for active patient records.
4.  System implementation must not disrupt existing hospital operations for more than 48 consecutive hours during go-live.

**Assumptions:**
1.  The term "authorized staff" refers to individuals with verified credentials and role-based permissions within the hospital, authenticated through the hospital's existing identity management system.
2.  "Existing hospital systems" refers to at least one other software system (e.g., lab information system, billing system) with which data exchange is necessary, and these systems will maintain their own availability and performance standards independently.
3.  "Healthcare regulations" primarily refer to data privacy and security standards such as HIPAA or regional equivalents, and the hospital will provide specific regulatory requirements during detailed design phases.
4.  Hospital staff will receive adequate training on the new system prior to deployment.
5.  The hospital will provide necessary hardware infrastructure to support the system's performance and availability requirements.
