FAIL
1. **Missing Requirement: Data Backup and Recovery.** The SRS does not specify requirements for data backup, disaster recovery, or business continuity. This is a critical non-functional requirement for a system managing sensitive patient data and hospital operations. There is no mention of Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) or Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
2. **Ambiguity: "Significant performance degradation" and "peak load".** In NFR-2, the terms "significant performance degradation" and "peak load" are subjective and not measurable. The requirement to support 250 concurrent users lacks a clear definition of what constitutes "support" (e.g., acceptable response times, error rates). This makes the requirement difficult to test and verify.
3. **Inconsistency: Availability Scope.** NFR-1 specifies audit logs must be retained for "a minimum of six years," which is a specific compliance detail. However, NFR-2 defines system availability as "99.5% availability during core hospital operating hours (06:00 to 22:00 local time, 365 days per year), excluding scheduled maintenance windows." This creates a potential conflict, as critical systems in a hospital often require 24/7 availability. The defined hours may not cover emergency or night shift operations, which is inconsistent with the system's purpose of managing patient care.
