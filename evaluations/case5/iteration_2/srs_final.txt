# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Hospital Management System (HMS)

### 1. Introduction
This document specifies the requirements for a Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to streamline hospital operations, manage patient information, coordinate staff activities, and maintain inventory. The system aims to improve efficiency, ensure data security, and support compliance with healthcare regulations while integrating with existing hospital infrastructure.

### 2. Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Patient Information Management**
*   The system SHALL provide a centralized, organized repository for patient medical histories, treatments, prescribed medications, and test results.
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to create, view, update, and deactivate patient records.
*   The system SHALL maintain a complete audit trail of all changes made to any patient record.

**FR-2: Appointment Scheduling**
*   The system SHALL allow authorized staff to book, reschedule, and cancel patient appointments.
*   The system SHALL prevent the double-booking of a patient, a staff member, or a room for the same date and time.
*   The system SHALL provide a view of scheduled appointments for patients, staff, and resources (e.g., rooms, equipment).

**FR-3: Inventory Management**
*   The system SHALL maintain a record of medical supplies, medications, and equipment, including quantities and locations.
*   The system SHALL update inventory quantities in real-time upon the recording of a disbursement or a new shipment receipt.
*   The system SHALL generate an alert when the quantity of a specific inventory item falls below a pre-defined threshold.

**FR-4: Staff Coordination & Communication**
*   The system SHALL provide a mechanism for authorized staff to send and receive internal messages or alerts.
*   The system SHALL allow the assignment of tasks or patients to specific staff members or roles.

**FR-5: System Integration**
*   The system SHALL be capable of exchanging data with existing, specified hospital systems.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Security & Compliance**
*   The system SHALL enforce role-based access controls (RBAC) so that users can only view and modify data and functions explicitly permitted for their assigned role.
*   The system SHALL encrypt all patient health information (PHI) both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3+ for data in transit).
*   The system SHALL generate and securely store immutable logs of all user authentication attempts, data access events, and data modifications for audit purposes. These logs SHALL be retained for a minimum of six years.
*   The system SHALL be designed and operated to comply with relevant healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR for applicable regions).

**NFR-2: Reliability, Performance & Availability**
*   The system SHALL maintain 99.5% availability, calculated monthly, with downtime defined as the system being unreachable or core transactional functions being inoperable for authorized users.
*   The system SHALL support a minimum of 250 concurrent users performing typical operations while maintaining a response time of less than 3 seconds for 95% of all common transactions (e.g., retrieving a patient record, booking an appointment) under that load.
*   The system's error rate for completed transactions SHALL not exceed 1% during sustained peak load conditions.

**NFR-3: Data Integrity & Recovery**
*   The system SHALL perform automated, encrypted, full database backups daily and incremental backups every 4 hours.
*   The system SHALL be designed to achieve a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of no more than 15 minutes of data loss and a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of no more than 4 hours for a complete system restoration following a major failure.
*   The system SHALL support a documented disaster recovery plan that includes procedures for restoring service from backups at an alternate location.

**NFR-4: Usability**
*   The system SHALL provide a user interface that enables a staff member with standard hospital IT training to successfully complete core tasks (e.g., schedule an appointment, update a record) on their first attempt without external assistance in 90% of observed cases.
*   The system SHALL provide context-sensitive help or guidance for all critical functions.

**NFR-5: Scalability & Integration**
*   The system's architecture SHALL support an increase in stored patient record volume by 20% per year for five years without requiring a major redesign or replacement of core hardware/software components.
*   The system SHALL use standardized protocols (e.g., HL7, FHIR, REST APIs) for all integration interfaces with other specified hospital systems.

### 4. Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**
1.  The system MUST operate within the hospital's existing network infrastructure and security perimeter.
2.  The system MUST use the hospital's existing user authentication directory (e.g., Active Directory) for staff credentials.
3.  All patient data MUST reside within the hospital's primary data center or an approved cloud region compliant with relevant data sovereignty laws.

**Assumptions:**
1.  The term "authorized staff" refers to individuals with verified credentials and role-based permissions provisioned within the hospital's identity management system.
2.  "Existing hospital systems" refers to at least one other software system (e.g., lab information system, billing system) with which data exchange is necessary, and the interfaces for these systems are documented and stable.
3.  "Healthcare regulations" primarily refer to data privacy and security standards such as HIPAA or regional equivalents, and the hospital's compliance office will provide specific interpretation.
4.  The hospital will provide the necessary training to staff on the system's core functions as part of the deployment plan.
