FAIL
1. **Missing Requirement (FR-2: Appointment Scheduling):** The requirement to "prevent the double-booking of a patient, a staff member, or a room" is ambiguous. It does not specify the system's behavior when a conflict is attempted (e.g., should it reject the booking, show a warning, or suggest alternatives?). Furthermore, there is no requirement for the system to search for or display available time slots for a given staff member or resource, which is a core function of scheduling.
2. **Missing Requirement (FR-5: System Integration):** The requirement is too vague. It states the system "SHALL be capable of exchanging data with existing, specified hospital systems" but does not specify the critical data flows, direction of exchange (import/export/bidirectional), or the required transactions (e.g., sending lab orders, receiving lab results, synchronizing patient demographics). This lacks the specificity needed for design and testing.
3. **Ambiguity & Missing Requirement (FR-1 & FR-4):** The term "deactivate" in FR-1 is ambiguous regarding patient records. It conflicts with the common regulatory requirement for data retention and prohibits deletion. The requirement should clarify if this means archiving, marking as inactive, or a true deletion, and under what rules. Separately, FR-4 mentions assigning "tasks or patients" but provides no requirements for tracking, updating status, or managing the lifecycle of these assigned tasks, which is a significant functional gap for staff coordination.
4. **Inconsistency (NFR-2: Performance):** The performance requirement specifies "250 concurrent users" but does not define a user profile or transaction mix. This makes the requirement ("response time of less than 3 seconds for 95% of all common transactions") untestable. A test with 250 users performing only the simplest transaction would not be equivalent to a realistic mix of appointments, record updates, and inventory checks.
5. **Missing Requirement (Security - Authentication):** While NFR-1 specifies RBAC and encryption, and a constraint mentions using the existing authentication directory, there is no explicit functional requirement for the system to authenticate users. The process for login, session management, password policies, and handling failed attempts is not specified, creating a major security gap.
