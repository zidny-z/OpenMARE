FAIL
1. Missing requirement: The SRS does not specify how a Student user's account is linked to a Parent/Guardian account, which is critical for the Parent's dashboard (FR4.1) and communication features (FR4.3). The user management section (FR5.2) mentions generating codes but does not define the association mechanism.
2. Ambiguity: Requirement FR2.5 states feedback is displayed "within 5 seconds of the Teacher saving the feedback." This is ambiguous regarding whether this is a real-time push notification or a page refresh requirement, and it does not specify if the student must be actively logged in to receive it.
3. Inconsistency: Constraint 4.1 states "Maximum individual file upload size: 500MB," but functional requirements FR1.2 and FR2.1 specify lower maximum sizes for specific file types (e.g., 50MB for documents, 20MB for images). The global constraint contradicts the specific functional limits.
