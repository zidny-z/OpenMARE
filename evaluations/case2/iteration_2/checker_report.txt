FAIL
1. **Missing Requirement: Data Retention and Deletion Policy.** The SRS does not specify requirements for how long student data (submissions, feedback, messages) will be retained, or procedures for data deletion upon account closure or student departure. This is a critical privacy and operational gap.
2. **Ambiguity: Performance Requirement NFR2.2.** The requirement states actions "SHALL complete within an acceptable time frame (e.g., <5 seconds)" under high-latency conditions. The parenthetical "(e.g., <5 seconds)" is ambiguous; it is unclear if this is an example or a firm requirement. It should be specified as a measurable target or removed.
3. **Inconsistency: Constraint on File Upload Size vs. Target Audience.** The maximum file upload size is specified as 500MB. For the target users (young students aged 4-8) and the listed file formats (JPG, PNG, MP4, MP3, PDF), a 500MB limit is excessively large and inconsistent with typical use cases (e.g., a child's drawing or short audio clip). This could lead to unnecessary storage costs and performance issues. A more appropriate, smaller limit should be defined.
