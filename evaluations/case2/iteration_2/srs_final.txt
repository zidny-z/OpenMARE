# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Educational Platform for Young Learners

### 1. Introduction
This document specifies requirements for an educational platform designed for young students (ages 4-8), their teachers, and parents/guardians. The system provides a centralized digital classroom environment where teachers can share content, assign work, and provide feedback, while students can submit assignments through an age-appropriate interface, and parents can monitor their child's progress and communicate with teachers.

### 2. Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Centralized Content Hub
* FR1.1: The system SHALL provide the Teacher with a dedicated, private digital space (e.g., a class homepage) for each class they manage.
* FR1.2: The system SHALL allow the Teacher to post and organize lesson materials (e.g., videos, document links, website URLs) within the class space.
* FR1.3: The system SHALL present the available lesson materials to the Student user in a single, consolidated view.

#### FR2: Assignment Submission & Feedback
* FR2.1: The system SHALL allow the Teacher to create assignments with a title, simple instructions, and an optional due date.
* FR2.2: The system SHALL allow the Student user to submit work in response to an assignment by uploading files (images, video, audio, documents) or entering text into a designated field.
* FR2.3: The system SHALL provide the Teacher with a consolidated view of all submissions for a given assignment.
* FR2.4: The system SHALL allow the Teacher to provide feedback on a student's submission. Feedback mechanisms SHALL include, at a minimum: text comments and a selection of pre-defined positive visual indicators (e.g., digital stickers, stamps).
* FR2.5: The system SHALL display the Teacher's feedback to the corresponding Student user within 5 seconds of the Teacher saving the feedback when the Student user is actively viewing their submission page.

#### FR3: Student-Facing Interface & Routine
* FR3.1: The Student user interface SHALL rely primarily on large, recognizable icons and images for navigation, with minimal required text reading.
* FR3.2: The system SHALL provide the Student user with a clear, visual list or board of their current and pending assignments.
* FR3.3: The system SHALL allow the Student user to view their submitted work and the associated Teacher feedback in a dedicated area.

#### FR4: Parent-Facing Interface & Communication
* FR4.1: The system SHALL provide Parent users with a dedicated view of their child's class space, including announcements and a summary of assigned/completed work.
* FR4.2: The system SHALL provide the Teacher with a tool to send text announcements to all Parents within a class.
* FR4.3: The system SHALL provide a direct, private communication channel between the Teacher and individual Parents (e.g., a simple messaging interface).

#### FR5: Access Control & User Management
* FR5.1: The system SHALL require user authentication (username/password or equivalent) for Teacher, Student, and Parent access.
* FR5.2: The system SHALL allow the Teacher to initiate and control the registration of Student and Parent accounts for their class.
* FR5.3: The system SHALL enforce that users can only view data for the class(es) to which they are explicitly registered. A Student or Parent from one class SHALL NOT be able to view the data of another class.
* FR5.4: The system SHALL provide the Teacher with a mechanism to generate unique invitation codes for Student accounts.
* FR5.5: The system SHALL provide the Teacher with a mechanism to generate unique invitation codes for Parent accounts that are specifically linked to individual Student accounts.
* FR5.6: When a Parent user registers using a Student-linked invitation code, the system SHALL automatically establish a permanent association between the Parent account and the corresponding Student account, granting the Parent access to that Student's data as specified in FR4.1 and FR4.3.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Usability & User Experience
* NFR1.1: The Student user interface SHALL be navigable by a child with emerging literacy skills, using consistent, large tap targets (buttons/icons) and clear visual cues.
* NFR1.2: The system's primary user workflows (e.g., submitting work, viewing assignments) for both Student and Parent users SHALL require no formal training to complete.
* NFR1.3: The system SHALL be tolerant of erroneous or accidental input (e.g., rapid multiple taps, pressing 'back') without crashing or losing user data, and SHALL provide clear, simple options to undo or correct actions.

#### NFR2: Performance & Compatibility
* NFR2.1: The system's core user interfaces SHALL be fully functional and legible on smartphone and tablet screens.
* NFR2.2: The system SHALL be usable with a high-latency internet connection (e.g., typical of low-bandwidth mobile data), meaning core page loads and submission actions SHALL complete within an acceptable time frame (e.g., <5 seconds) under such conditions.

#### NFR3: Security & Privacy
* NFR3.1: The system SHALL not include any public user profiles, searchable user directories, or open forums/chat rooms accessible to users.
* NFR3.2: All user communication (Teacher-Parent, system announcements) SHALL be confined to the private channels within the system; there SHALL be no capability for unstructured, open communication between Students or between Parents of different children.
* NFR3.3: The system SHALL transmit and store all user data (including submitted work and messages) using industry-standard encryption.

#### NFR4: Operational & Business
* NFR4.1: The initial setup of a class by a Teacher (including adding students and parents) SHALL be achievable within a predictable, short timeframe (e.g., less than 30 minutes for a class of 20).
* NFR4.2: The system's pricing model SHALL have predictable, recurring costs (e.g., a fixed monthly or annual subscription per class/teacher) without variable per-student or per-assignment fees.

### 4. Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints
1. The system SHALL be accessible via modern web browsers on iOS and Android mobile devices.
2. The system SHALL support the following file formats for student submissions: JPG, PNG, MP4, MP3, PDF.
3. Maximum individual file upload size: 500MB.
4. The system SHALL be available 99.5% of the time during standard school hours (7 AM to 7 PM local time, Monday-Friday).

#### Assumptions
1. The system's users are: a Teacher, Young Students (approximately ages 4-8), and Parents/Guardians.
2. The Teacher manages one or more discrete classes/groups of students.
3. All students and parents must be explicitly registered and associated with a specific class by the Teacher to gain access.
4. "Work" or "assignments" can include digital files (images, videos, documents) and simple text responses.
5. Each Student will have at least one Parent/Guardian account associated with them.
6. Teachers have basic digital literacy skills sufficient to manage class rosters and create assignments.
7. Parents have access to a smartphone or computer to view their child's progress and communicate with teachers.
