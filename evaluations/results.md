### Initial Draft
| Study Case No. | Completeness | Clarity | Consistency | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 2 | 1.5 | 2 | 2 | 5.5 |
| 3 | 1.25 | 2 | 2 | 5.25 |
| 4 | 1.25 | 1.25 | 2 | 4.5 |
| 5 | 1.25 | 1.25 | 2 | 4.5 |

### Final Draft
| Study Case No. | Completeness | Clarity | Consistency | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 1.75 | 2 | 2 | 5.75 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 |
| 5 | 1.25 | 1.25 | 2 | 4.5 |

#### Score Summary:
- Initial Draft Total: 4 + 5.5 + 5.25 + 4.5 + 4.5 = 23.75
- Initial Draft Average: 23.75 / 5 = 4.75
- Final Draft Total: 6 + 4 + 5.75 + 6 + 4.5 = 26.25
- Final Draft Average: 26.25 / 5 = 5.25

#### Improvement Summary:
1. Enhanced clarity and consistency across study cases.
2. Provided more detailed explanations for each case.
3. Improved the overall document structure and organization.

#### Notes:
For less familiar use cases (e.g., LMS for kids, Hospital Management System), the initial draft scores were lower due to insufficient detail and inconsistencies. The final draft addressed these issues, leading to higher scores. An anomaly was observed in Use Case 2, where the final draft score decreased compared to the initial iteration.

#### Next Steps for Improvement:
- Refine prompt engineering techniques.
- Incorporate more detailed explanations for each study case.
- Enhance overall document structure and organization.
- Implement RAG and workspace management per study case to ensure consistency and completeness.
- Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and identify areas for refinement.
