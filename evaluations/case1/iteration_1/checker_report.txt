FAIL
1. Missing requirement for system initialization and first-time setup process. There is no specification for how a user initially configures the system, connects the first device, or establishes the primary administrator account.
2. Ambiguity in FR1.3 regarding "supported household devices." The term "supported" is not defined. There is no requirement specifying how a user determines if a device is supported, or if the system must provide a list or discovery mechanism for compatible devices.
3. Inconsistency between NFR2.2 and the functional requirements. NFR2.2 states the system "SHALL maintain local control of devices... during a loss of internet connectivity," but FR2.1 and FR2.2 define remote access as a core requirement without clarifying if remote access is a subset of "core monitoring and control capabilities" that must remain available locally. The relationship between local and remote functionality during an outage is unclear.
4. Missing requirement for system and data backup/recovery. There is no specification for backing up user configurations, automation rules, or device settings, or for restoring the system after a failure or reset.
5. Ambiguity in NFR3.1 and NFR3.2 regarding the conditions under which the performance metrics apply. It is unclear if the 5-second status update (NFR3.1) and 2-second command feedback (NFR3.2) are required for both local and remote access scenarios, or only under optimal network conditions.
6. Missing requirement for system updates and maintenance. There is no specification for how the system software/firmware is updated, how updates are delivered, or how user consent and notification for updates are handled.
7. Ambiguity in NFR5.1 regarding "user authentication." The method (e.g., password, biometric, two-factor) and strength of authentication are not specified, creating a potential security gap.
8. Inconsistency in the scope of NFR4.1. It states the system "SHALL be accessible from recent versions of major mobile and desktop operating systems," but does not define what constitutes a "recent version," leaving a compatibility gap.
