# Smart Home Control System: Stakeholder Overview

## Primary Goals
- Enable homeowners to monitor household devices from anywhere (work, vacation, etc.)
- Allow remote control of devices (lights, thermostat, appliances, security systems)
- Provide real-time status updates on device operations and home conditions
- Create a unified interface for managing multiple different devices and brands
- Ensure family members can easily use the system regardless of technical skill

## Key Needs
- Simple, intuitive interface that doesn't require technical expertise
- Reliable access to home systems with minimal downtime
- Ability to set schedules and automation rules (like "turn lights on at sunset")
- Notifications for important events (water leak detected, door left open, temperature extremes)
- Support for various household devices we already own and might purchase in future
- Different access levels for different family members (parents vs. children)

## Constraints
- Must work within typical household budgets (avoiding expensive professional installation)
- Shouldn't require major home renovations or rewiring
- Need to accommodate homes with varying internet connection qualities
- Must respect privacy concerns about home monitoring
- Should be usable by people with different physical abilities and tech comfort levels
- Needs to work with existing smartphones and tablets people already own

## Pain Points with Current Situation
- Too many separate apps for different devices (thermostat, lights, cameras all need different apps)
- Difficulty knowing if devices are actually responding to commands
- Worry about security when away from home (did I lock the door? turn off the oven?)
- Energy waste from devices left on unnecessarily
- Complexity of setting up automation between different brand devices
- Family conflicts over thermostat settings and lighting
- Difficulty helping elderly relatives manage their home systems remotely
- Concerns about system reliability during internet outages
