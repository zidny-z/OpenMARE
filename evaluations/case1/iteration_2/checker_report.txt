FAIL
1. Missing requirement: The SRS does not specify how the system handles device communication failures or unresponsive devices. There is no requirement for retry logic, error logging, or user notification when a command fails to reach a device.
2. Ambiguity: Requirement FR2.7 states "provide visual indication when attempting to add an unsupported device." The term "visual indication" is ambiguous. It should specify whether this applies to all user interfaces (mobile app, web portal) and what form the indication takes (e.g., error message, icon, color change).
3. Inconsistency: Requirement NFR4.1 states compatibility with "current and previous major versions" of mobile OS, while the Assumptions section (4.2, point 4) defines "Recent versions" as "versions released within the past 24 months." These are different criteria and could conflict. The compatibility requirement should be clarified to align with a specific time-based or version-based standard.
