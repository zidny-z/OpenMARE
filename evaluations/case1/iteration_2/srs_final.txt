# Software Requirements Specification (SRS): Smart Home Automation System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for a Smart Home Automation System that provides unified control, monitoring, and automation of household IoT devices. The system enables homeowners to manage multiple smart devices from different manufacturers through a single interface, both locally and remotely.

### 1.2 Scope
The system includes a central hub/controller, user interfaces (mobile app and web portal), cloud services for remote access, and integration capabilities with third-party smart devices. The system does not include the manufacturing of smart devices themselves but provides the platform to integrate and control them.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Household Device**: A physical IoT unit (smart plug, light bulb, lock, sensor, thermostat, etc.) that can be monitored or controlled.
- **Supported Device**: A household device that is compatible with the system's communication protocols and has been verified to work with the system's integration layer.
- **Local Access**: Access to the system from within the home's local network.
- **Remote Access**: Access to the system from outside the home's local network via the internet.
- **Administrator**: The primary user account with full system configuration privileges.
