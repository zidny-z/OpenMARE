```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

This project is for research purposes only and not suited for production use.
The reference for this project is the paper:
"OpenMARE: A Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"
by the authors of this project
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03256)

This is just a super minimal program to demonstrate the basic idea of the framework:

* Not all features are implemented
* Not optimized for performance
* Only core workflow is shown

## Evaluation
For evaluation results, check the `evaluations/` folder or `results.md`.

## Final Notes
**Custom the prompts for better results** ->this is the key.
I think you dont need a talk to [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zidni-zainul/).
Just read the paper for better understanding and better project details
that I didnt implement here.
